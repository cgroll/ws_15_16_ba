  abstract =     {Despite powerful advances in yield curve modeling in
                  the last twenty years, comparatively little
                  attention has been paid to the key practical problem
                  of forecasting the yield curve. In this paper we do
                  so. We use neither the no-arbitrage approach, which
                  focuses on accurately fitting the cross section of
                  interest rates at any given time but neglects
                  time-series dynamics, nor the equilibrium approach,
                  which focuses on time-series dynamics (primarily
                  those of the instantaneous rate) but pays
                  comparatively little attention to fitting the entire
                  cross section at any given time and has been shown
                  to forecast poorly. Instead, we use variations on
                  the Nelson-Siegel exponential components framework
                  to model the entire yield curve, period-by-period,
                  as a three dimensional parameter evolving
                  dynamically. We show that the three time-varying
                  parameters may be interpreted as factors
                  corresponding to level, slope and curvature, and
                  that they may be estimated with high efficiency. We
                  propose and estimate autoregressive models for the
                  factors, and we show that our models are consistent
                  with a variety of stylized facts regarding the yield
                  curve. We use our models to produce term-structure
                  forecasts at both short and long horizons
                  encouraging results. In particular, our forecasts
                  appear much more accurate at long horizons than
                  various standard benchmark forecasts.},

                  regressions cannot easily answer this question when
                  the number of candidate variables is large and when
                  cross-terms might be important as well. We introduce
                  a new method, deep conditional portfolio sorts, that
                  can be used in this context. To estimate the model,
                  we import ideas from the machine learning literature
                  and tailor them to our setting. We apply the method
                  to past-return based predictions, and we recover
                  short-term returns (i.e. the past six most recent
                  one-month returns) as the most important predictors.
                  A trading strategy based on these findings has
                  Sharpe and information ratios that are about twice
                  as high as in a Fama-MacBeth framework that accounts
                  for two-way interactions. Transaction costs do not
